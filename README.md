Welcome to the new Manchester Hackspace PrintNC page.

The machine is named Chunky.

Chunky has been built from scratch in the Hackspace and on loan from the member who built it. It is largely based on the open source project PrintNC v4, though with some modifications. The PrintNC is successfully used in industry and commercially, and is a modern and currently maintained open source project.

Chunky is so named due to the small work area of 600x450 (actually 500, but the last 50 is reserved for ATC and toolsetting) and the rigid specifications specifically designed by the owner for excellent drilling and boring. 

Chunky is able to cut all sorts of plastics and wood, aluminium and other soft metals, mild steel, as well as stainless and toolsteel with the correct experience. It will hopefully be available soon for member use and features the following specifications:

Around 500kg in total. 
ER20 water cooled spindle with ceramic bearings
Capable of 25k mm/min rapids, and 20k feed cutting soft woods
Cuts wood at 16k mm/min with 45mm step down 
Controller is the excellent FlexiHal by expatria 
GRBLHAL software, interfaced through a sender
Real time control and jog controller with DRO
Semi automatic tool changing, 3d probing, and tool setting 
Fully enclosed, with 3 cameras for monitoring, including a spindle camera
Vacuum, air lines, and advanced MQL system for metals
Over 500 holes tapped during construction!
Self designed ATC and vacuum vices in progress
Plans for a 4th (lathe) axis
Holds accuracy to approximately 0.05mm

For getting started with Chunky you'll need to learn some CAD and CAM skills, both of which is recommended to be done in Autodesk Fusion360. You will also need the GRBLHAL postprocessor from Dietz. Tools will be available in the space, both basic (free induction tooling) and advanced (available to purchase at fair prices.)

The documentation process on learning is coming soon. I will first upload a quick 'howto' on how to cad and cam a peanut bowl for the wood cnc in the space.
